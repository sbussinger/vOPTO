# vOPTO
## Support for OPTO on Windows x64

This is a fork of the vDos project by Jos Schaars, supporting 16 bit DOS applications running under Windows. 

This fork is specifically tailored for use with the OPTO Optometric Practice Management program to allow execution on 64 bit versions of Windows.

The original vDos project can be found at [http://sourceforge.net/projects/vdos/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/vdos/). vDos was derived from the DOSBox project found at [http://sourceforge.net/projects/dosbox/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dosbox/). The license for this fork is GPLv2 to match the original DOSBox project as well as the vDos project.

## Features
This fork tracks the master source code of the vDos project and adds several features necessary to support the OPTO program.
